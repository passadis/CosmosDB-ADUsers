# Register and Import AD Users from Cosmos DB and Azure Functions with HTML and Static Apps 

This Repo contains all the Pipelines needed to deploy a recent Solution that imports AD Users from an HTML Registration form. The form is hosted on Azure Static Apps, for later updates and enhancements.The procedure inserts the fields into Comsos DB via Azure Functions HTTP Trigger, checks for Unique ID on the nickname value, and if it is OK the data is stored. Another Function is triggered and the User details are transfromed to CSV and Stored in a Storage Blob. From there we can have an hourly or a Scheduled Trigger to start a Build Pipeline which copies the CSV into a Self Hosted DevOps Agent and uses MS Graph SDK (Powershell) to import the users to AzureAD.

A really nice Solution which integrates Azure Services & DevOps while most of the Deployment is automated.

We are going to need:
*An Azure Subscription
*VS Code
*A DevOps Organization
*A Microsoft 365 Tenant with some trial licenses ( This is optional as the MS Graph also assigns the users into a Group with Licenses)
*Patience!

Here is a more detailed Diagram with the components we use. Remeber every Resource has Private Endpoint and we are using Service Principals for the Authentication and Authorization Tasks.
